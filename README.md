## Features and important information
ArchWSL2 has the following features during the installation stage.
* Increase virtual disk size from the default 256GB
* Create a new user and set the user as default
* ArchWSL2 Supports systemd natively if you are running wsl v0.67.6 (more details here) and above. For earlier versions of wsl, systemd is supported using diddledani's one-script-wsl2-systemd. This is done automatically during initial setup.
* ArchWSL2 includes a wsl.conf file which only has [section headers](https://i.postimg.cc/MZ4DC1Fw/Screenshot-2022-02-02-071533.png). Users can use this file to configure the distro to their liking. You can read more about wsl.conf and its configuration settings [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config).

## Requirements
* For x64 systems: Version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or higher.
* For ARM64 systems: Version 2004 or higher, with Build 19041 or higher.
* Builds lower than 18362 do not support WSL 2.
* If you are running Windows 10 version 2004 or higher, you can install all components required to run wsl2 with a single command. This will install ubuntu by default. More details are available [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/install-wsl-with-a-single-command-now-available-in-windows-10-version-2004-and-higher/).
	```cmd
	wsl.exe --install
	```
* If you are running Windows 10 lower then version 2004, follow the steps below. For more details, check [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) microsoft document.
	* Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux feature.
	```cmd
	dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
	```
	* Enable Virtual Machine feature
	```cmd
	dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
	```
	* Download and install the latest Linux kernel update package from [here](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi).

## How to install
* Make sure all the steps mentioned under "Requirements" are completed.
* [Download](https://github.com/sileshn/ArchWSL2/releases/latest) installer zip
* Extract all files in zip file to same directory
* Set version 2 as default. Note that this step is required only for manual installation.
  ```dos
  wsl --set-default-version 2
  ```
* Run Arch.exe to extract rootfs and register to WSL

**Note:**
Exe filename is using the instance name to register. If you rename it you can register with a diffrent name and have multiple installs.

## How to setup
ArchWSL2 will ask you to create a new user during its first run. If you choose to create a new user during the first run, the steps below are not required unless you want to create additional users.

Open Arch.exe and run the following commands.
```dos
passwd
useradd -m -g users -G wheel -s /bin/bash <username>
echo "%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL" >/etc/sudoers.d/wheel
passwd <username>
exit
```

You can set the user you created as default user using 2 methods.

Open Arch.exe, run the following command (replace username with the actual username you created).
```dos
sed -i '/\[user\]/a default = username' /etc/wsl.conf
```

Shutdown and restart the distro (this step is important).

(or)

Execute the command below in a windows cmd terminal from the directory where Arch.exe is installed.
```dos
>Arch.exe config --default-user <username>
```
